    Hi, I'm [Your Name], a first-year Ph.D. student supervised by [Prof. Sung Kyu Lim](http://limsk.ece.gatech.edu) at [Georgia Tech Computer-aided Design Lab(GTCAD)](https://www.gtcad.gatech.edu).
    My research interests are in 3D VLSI, and I'm currently working on topics related to bumps and pads legalization for 3D ICs.

    I completed my undergraduate studies at National Taiwan University in 2022, where I achieved 4.09/4.30. 
    During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of interning at Synopsys (2021 summer) and Cadence (2020 summer), 
    where I worked on improving the state-of-art EDA tools.

    Prof. Lim's lab has provided me with an excellent opportunity to explore my research interests and gain valuable experience in the field of 3D VLSI. 
    To learn more about the lab and its ongoing research projects, please visit [GTCAD](https://www.gtcad.gatech.edu).

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
